This project is the final task in the course. In this assignment we get a graph, a number of agents, and pokemons. The goal of the game is to collect as much pokemons as we can in the time given to each level (0-15)
We took the graph implementation from our [prevoius assignment](https://github.com/roee-tal/EX3-OOP)

## The algorithm
The same algorithm works on both cases of one agent and more than one.


## Download and run

First clone the project.
Next run the jar file like this: java -jar Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar __
  Instead of the underscore put a number between 0 and 15 (levels).

Last open the project in Pycharm and run the GUI file with a 3.8 python interpreter:
  Edit the configuration by changing the 'Script path' to your local directory and specify to Ex4\Client\GUI.py
